each spring container is a consumer, and each jvm can only exists one container/consumer




------------------ dubbo part --------------------
there's a problem, for example
step1, A async call B
step2, B sync call C

result: B can not get return value from C

solution1: let B async call C
solution2: let B sync call C.echo at first, then sync call C again.

1.bolt need to invoke collector.ack(tuple), then spout's ack() method will be invoked
2.fieldsGrouping, same word will be sent to same bolt, but bolt can receive different words, these words are different
for instance:
word list: one, two, three, four, five
bolt thread: we have to bolt running
valid result: one, two, three will only reach at bolt-1, and four, five will only reach bolt-2
task means thread
worker mean jvm instance
